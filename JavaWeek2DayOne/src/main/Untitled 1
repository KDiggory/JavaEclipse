JDBC CRUD
---------

Java Database Connectivity - an application programming interface that allows us to connect a database with our Java application

To access data in the db we need 4 things
1 - open the connection
2 - create/prepare a statement
3 - execute the statement
4 - close the connection

Should be done in a try/catch/finalise or try with resources block

JDBC allows us to connect to a database and add/delete or edit things.
