		Static variables and methods
		---------------------------
		
Static means the method can be used without making an instance of the class it is in
A static variable belongs to the class, not instances of that class. A static method can be called without instantiating the class
A static class must be nested within a class

		Final 
		-----
		
Final can be used with variable, method or class

variable - can no longer change the value of that variable
method - can no longer override that method
class - can not have inheritance from this class

When to use final?

variable - for a constant such as PI, or another thing that isnt going to change. Probably a mathmatical thing
method - 
class -
